    <p><strong>Burato, M.</strong> (2025). <em>Sustainability strategies and firm value.</em></p>
     <p class="details">Job Market Paper, 2025</p>
    <p>Despite the diffusion of sustainability as a legitimate strategic logic, scholarly evidence of its impact on firm value remains tentative. The prevailing emphasis on a "local business case," which focuses on proximate mechanisms, provides limited strategic guidance on how firms should adapt their behavior as systemic boundaries become more salient. This paper bridges this gap by developing a framework, grounded in complexity theory, that links the value of sustainability strategies to their ability to manage a multi-level feedback loop between firm operations and systemic outcomes. We posit that firms must develop strategic complexity, the degree of sophistication of their strategies in terms of the breadth of implied sustainability behaviors, to match the systemic complexity of the environment they are embedded in. Due to cognitive and organizational costs, this relationship is not linear but follows an inverted U-shape. Furthermore, we hypothesize that the optimal point of this curve shifts when exogenous shocks alter systemic complexity. To test these predictions, we develop a novel methodology, applying a hierarchical Bayesian model to a dataset of over 200,000 corporate sustainability initiatives by 1,186 firms to measure the complexity of their enacted strategies. Our empirical design leverages the European Union's \lq\lq Fit for 55" policy as a quasi-natural experiment in a continuous treatment, triple difference-in-differences framework. Our results support both hypotheses: we find a curvilinear relationship between strategic complexity and firm financial value, and show that the vertex of this curve shifts toward higher complexity for EU firms following the regulatory shock.</p>

        <p><strong>Burato, M.</strong>, Pellegrino, F., & Zollo, M. (2025). <em>Heterogeneity in Corporate Sustainability Initiatives and Stock Returns.</em></p>
        <p class="details">Target journal: Management Science, nominated for Best Methods paper at SMS Conference 2025, presented (upcoming) at SMS Conference 2025, SEI Conference 2025</p>
        <p>This paper re-examines the relationship between corporate sustainability behavior and stock returns. The analysis is based portfolios of stocks according to three firm-level signals with increasing level of strategic focus of sustainability activities (advocacy, preparation, and transformation) based on the retrieval, via AI / transformer models, of 1.3 million initiatives from 75,000 sustainability reports. The findings show that only companies with higher transformation are linked to higher future ROA and enjoy significant positive alpha. Furthermore, we document a clear market learning curve that suggest markets are becoming more efficient in pricing sustainability.</p>

        <p><strong>Burato, M.</strong>, & Henisz, W. (2025). <em>Corporate purpose as a redistribution policy announcement in the stakeholder firm.</em></p>
        <p class="details">Target journal: Academy of Management Review</p>
        <p>This paper develops a novel formalization of the theory of the firm that includes key insights from stakeholder governance, including collective action problems such as shirking and infighting, as well as externalities of the production process. The theoretical model is rooted in cooperative game theory and grants management key levers to ensure the well functioning of the stakeholder coalition and ensuring long-term value generation. In particular, we simulate different redistribution policy announcements (a promised <em>corporate purpose</em>) and their effect cascade on stakeholder behavior and firm performance both formally and via simulations.</p>

        <p><strong>Burato, M.</strong>, & Henisz, W. (2025). <em>Capitalizing Sustainability Investments.</em></p>
        <p class="details">Target journal: Strategic Management Journal</p>
        <p>This paper links the existing open question of the documented increase in intangible capital that has been a key feature of market evaluation in the last decade with the role of sustainability and CSR activities by corporations. The analysis relies on the measurement of latent intangible capital accumulation and depreciation from multiple sources, including sustainability investments, using structural equation modeling. Our preliminary findings suggest that there is significant heterogeneity in firm efficiency in utilizing intangible capital from sustainability, but once that link is established the link to both financial and non-financial performance is strong.</p>

        <p class="details">Target journal: Organization Science</p>
        <p>This paper examines corporate problemistic search behavior when faced by performance aspirations on two different goals, a financial and an environmental one. The measurement of environmental search behavior intensity is based on changes in the portfolio of environmental sustainability initiatives year-on-year, while both historical and peer performance converge in forming aspiration level both on environmental (GHG emissions) and financial (net income) terms.</p>

        <p class="details">Target journal: Strategic Management Journal, presented at SMS Conference 2024</p>
        <p>This paper addresses the business case for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) by investigating if the "substantiveness" of a firm's environmental actions impacts its financial performance. The analysis of a large dataset of sustainability initiatives reveals that substantive actions are associated with reduced GHG emissions and, subsequently through bootstrapped mediation analysis, improved operating performance.</p>

        <p><strong>Burato, M.</strong>, Vastola, V., Tang, S., & Cenci, S. (2024). <em>Organizational System Thinking as a Strategic Tool to Manage Crises.</em></p>
        <p class="details">Target journal: Management Science</p>
        <p>This paper is a direct follow-up on the already published <em>PNAS</em> that established organizational system thinking (OST) as a construct. The core argument is that firms with a higher capacity for system thinking develop a more diversified portfolio of sustainability actions. This diversity is theorized to enhance a firm's stability during a crisis by mitigating risks and also supports superior adaptation and performance recovery after the shock. The analysis is centered around a DiD design with OST as continuous treatment for energy companies pre and post the 2014 oil crisis.</p>

        <p><strong>Burato, M.</strong>, & Kosowski, R. (2023). <em>Disclosing sustainability informaiton: an event study perspective.</em></p>
        <p class="details">Target journal: Journal of Financial Economics</p>
        <p>This paper builds on the literature stream in finance and accounting that guages short-term market reactions to new information made available by corporation. In particular, it is fairly known that financial reactions to non-financials disclosures are generally weak, but little evidence has been brought forward regarding the differential reaction to different contents that are being disclosed. The analysis consists in the construction of an event study around sustainability report disclosure dates to examine cumulative abnormal returns associated with different sustainability strategies. Results show that markets do react to environmental substantive actions, while falling flat on social issues and symbolic activities.</p>
