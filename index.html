                        <h2>About Me</h2>
                        <p>Welcome to my website! I am currently a 5th year PhD student in Strategy at Imperial College London.</p>
                        <p>My research interests lie at the intersection of strategy, sustainability, decision science, and organizational economics. I am passionate about how firms implement non-market adaptation strategies in relation to corporate sustainability.</p>
                        <p>I hold a Master of Research from Imperial College London, with distinction. I previously obtained a MSc in Economics and Social Sciences from Bocconi University, cum laude, in joint digree with UCLouvain and UNamour. I also received my BSc in Economics and Finance from Bocconi University.</p>

                <p>The overarching goal of my research is to explain corporate sustainability decisions in light of their implications for the firm's and societal outcomes, with explicit theorizing on the behavioral and contextual mechanisms that led to the emergence of those decisions.</p>
                <p>Here are some of my key research contributions:</p>

                    <h3>Sustainability strategies and firm value</h3>
                    <p class="authors">Matteo Burato</p>
                    <p class="journal">Job Market Paper, 2025</p>
                    <p class="description">Repeated past behavior can, under certain conditions, qualify as an emergent strategy that organizations employ to achieve their various goals. Through a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model that reads sustainability reports and classifies the actions described there, I can build a structural-dynamic latent variable Bayesian framework that extracts specific “strategic archetypes” from thousands of corporate actions. These archetypes are very different from one another, and organizations may choose to achieve a strategic mix that draws from many of them. I measure the sustainability strategies firms adhere to year on year, how consistent they are over time, and how different from their country-industry peers. In the paper, I leverage complexity theory to show that increasingly complex strategies are value-enhancing for firms, because of their ability to better cope with more fine-grained outcome variability in the business environment, up to a point where cognitive and organizational costs become too extreme to field an overly complex strategic mix.</p>

                    <h3>Assessing the effectiveness of interdependent corporate sustainability choices</h3>
                    <p class="authors">Simone Cenci, Matteo Burato, Marek Rei, Maurizio Zollo</p>
                    <p class="journal">Published in the Npj Climate Action, 2025</p>
                    <p class="description">In this paper, we investigate how the interdependence of corporate sustainability choices impacts the integrated financial and environmental performance of firms in energy and energy-intensive sectors. To do this, we developed an empirical framework based on the "fitness landscape" concept, where a company's performance is a function of its sustainability actions and financial characteristics. We empirically estimate these fitness landscapes with random forest models, and model corporate search on the landscape using genetic algorithms. Our study found that while companies' sustainability choices have a more positive impact on performance than random actions would, they significantly underperform compared to hypothetical "quasioptimal" choices. Importantly, firms behaviour is narrowly clustered around ''best practices’’, while the model suggests much more heterogeneous solutions depending on firm characteristics.</p>

                    <h3>Organizational system thinking as a cognitive framework to meet climate targets</h3>
                    <p class="authors">Matteo Burato, Samuel Tang, Vincenzo Vastola, Simone Cenci</p>
                    <p class="journal">Published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 2023</p>
                    <p class="description">I explore the role of system thinking as a paradigm of organizational cognition and its role in guiding firms' effectiveness when tackling complex global issues. Indeed, the grand challenges that dominate our age cannot be appreciated (and thus addressed properly) without a systemic perspective. This requires organizations, as well as policymakers and individuals, to embrace a congruent way of thinking and shape their behavior. In the paper, I develop organizational system thinking as a construct that emerges from the collective negotiated cognition of organizational decision-makers. System-thinking organizations successfully recognize the intertwined causal web that constitutes their business environment and therefore are more capable of directing their strategic actions to complex systemic goals. Empirically, My coauthors and I focused on the environmental challenge and used NLP methods to identify system thinking cues in the organizations’ answers to various environmental-related questions within the Carbon Disclosure Project. We successfully linked them to organizational effectiveness in adhering to the science-based targets set by the Paris Agreement of 2015-16. I am currently working on two follow-up works on this line of research. On one end, we are working on a difference-in-difference design that links organizational system thinking and organizational resilience in crisis periods. On the other, we are engaged in grant writing to study organizational system thinking direct emergence in an experimental setting.</p>

                    <h3>The alignment of companies’ sustainability behavior and emissions with global climate targets</h3>
                    <p class="authors">Simone Cenci, Matteo Burato, Marek Rei, Maurizio Zollo</p>
                    <p class="journal">Published in Nature Communications, 2023</p>
                    <p class="description">In this paper, we developed a novel framework using natural language processing to analyze thousands of corporate sustainability reports, creating a comprehensive database of climate-related actions and their associated goals (specifically, UN Sustainable Development Goals) from 2010 to 2020. We find that the misalignment between corporate climate goals and outcomes stems from a widespread over-investment in internal risk mitigation actions rather than innovation and cooperation to advance energy goals. The research demonstrates that simply undertaking more initiatives does not correlate with better climate performance; rather, the type of action is the critical factor. Companies with emission pathways aligned with the Paris Agreement prioritize innovation (like R&D and new product development) and energy-focused goals (SDG 7), whereas misaligned companies tend to focus more on managing existing assets and procedures.</p>
