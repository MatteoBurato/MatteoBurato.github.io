    <h3>Ph.D. Research at Imperial College London - Imperial Business School</h3>
    <p>My research studies the evolution of corporate practices related to the integration of environmental and social impact in business strategies. The overarching question I tackle is what are the evolutionary antecedents and firm-value consequences of sustainability strategies. More specifically, I am working on the following dissertation chapters:</p>

            <h3>1: Cognitive antecedents of corporate sustainability</h3>
            <div class="foldable-content">
                <p class="description">First, I explore how system thinking as a paradigm of organizational cognition guides firms' effectiveness in addressing complex global issues. Indeed, the grand challenges that dominate our age cannot be appreciated (and thus addressed properly) without a systemic perspective. This requires organizations to embrace a congruent way of thinking and shape their behavior. This research stream yielded my first first-authored publication, published on the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em>. In the paper, I develop organizational system thinking as a construct that emerges from the collective negotiated cognition of organizational decision-makers. System-thinking organizations successfully recognize the intertwined causal web that constitutes their business environment and therefore are more capable of directing their strategic actions to complex systemic goals. Empirically, I focused on the environmental challenge and used NLP methods to identify system thinking cues in the organizationsâ€™ answers to various environmental-related questions within the Carbon Disclosure Project. We successfully linked them to organizational effectiveness in adhering to the science-based targets set by the Paris Agreement of 2015-16. I am currently working on two follow-up projects related to this line of research. On one end, I am working on a difference-in-difference design that links organizational system thinking and organizational resilience in crisis periods. On the other hand, I am engaged in grant writing to study organizational system thinking, direct emergence in an experimental setting.</p>

            <h3>2: The evolution of sustainability strategies</h3>
            <div class="foldable-content">
                <p class="description">
                    The second chapter examines the emergence of sustainability strategies and their impact on firm value. It leverages AI methods to look at behavioral patterns in past sustainability actions. Repeated past behavior can, under certain conditions, qualify as an emergent strategy that organizations employ to achieve their various goals. In the paper, I leverage complexity theory and system thinking to argue that increasingly complex strategies can be value-enhancing for firms, because of their ability to better cope with more fine-grained outcome variability in the business environment, up to a point where cognitive and organizational costs become too extreme to field an overly complex strategic mix. Crucially, this complexity tipping point is directly related to the complexity of the business environment: complex strategic action becomes more valuable when embedded in more complex systems. Sustainability, in particular, is at the forefront of this dynamic, as it forgoes linear, reductionist logics in favor of multistakeholder management, management of externalities, and engagement with systemic boundaries. I test this theory by empirically extracting emergent strategies from thousands of corporate actions through: (a) a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model that reads sustainability reports and classifies the initiatives they describe, and (b) a dynamic-structural latent variable model (based on MCMC and SVI) that recovers the decision making patterns behind co-occurence of initiatives and their complexity.
                    Even though I cannot directly gauge the level of environmental complexity, I use a change in green policy by the European Union as a case of landscape redesign that selectively affects low-performance-low-complexity firm strategies, thus exogenously increasing environmental complexity. Results from a structural difference-in-difference design with generalized covariance balancing propensity score estimation comparing European and US firms support the inverted U-shaped relationship between sustainability complexity and firm value, as well as the importance of matching internal (firm strategic) and external (systemic) complexity.

            <h3>3: The financial consequences of sustainability initiatives</h3>
            <div class="foldable-content">
                <p class="description">My third chapter addresses how financial markets interpret and value corporate sustainability strategies. Building on literature examining ESG performance and market reactions I develop a theory that explains why markets struggle to accurately price sustainability. Focusing on public firms traded in the US and in the Euro Area from 2013 to 2023, I use corporate strategic sustainability activities to construct three market signals with increasing levels of strategic focus: advocacy (low), preparation (medium: HRM and measurement), and transformation (high: innovation and organizational change). Results show that only companies with higher transformation are linked to future higher ROA. In contrast, firms with high advocacy, preparation, or conventional ESG ratings (S&P, LSEG) show no such positive link to profitability. Moreover, portfolios of stocks with high transformation alone exhibited a significant positive alpha throughout our sample period (2.5% annualized) in Fama-French factor regression analyses. These findings suggest that markets have been underestimating complex transformative initiatives and their potential to affect fundamentals. Finally, I am able to document a clear market learning curve, as this alpha was slowly arbitraged away, decaying as markets became more efficient at pricing complex strategies.</p>

    <h3>Research Fellow at the ESG Initiative, The Wharton School</h3>
    <p>In January 2024, I visited the Management department at the Wharton School for a year. There, I joined the ESG Initiative as a research fellow and I am now continuing my affiliation remotely. As part of this collaboration, I am working on two main streams of research. The first involves gathering novel insights from the connection of new datasets spanning from news collection, negative externalities, risks, and corporate actions data. In this area, I am leading a project focusing on estimating latent stakeholder capital accumulation through ESG investments by public corporations, and the consequent effect on both financial and non-financial performances. The second leverages cooperative game theory to build a formal model of stakeholder interactions, linking value capture and stakeholder theories.</p>

    <h3>Research Affiliate at the Leonardo Centre, Imperial Business School</h3>
    <p>In parallel with my Ph.D. research, I am part of the core team of the Leonardo Centre on Business for Society. My role in the Centre includes participation in the collective effort to develop and implement quantitative methods to collect and analyze sustainability initiatives, classified by behavioural aspects, SDGs, and stakeholders. To this end, we use web crawlers and several machine-learning algorithms, including tokenizers and classifiers. The resulting dataset is actively used in some of my projects. I also contribute to the Centre's field experiment work by providing quantitative insights at the company, sector, and country levels of analysis.</p>

        <span class="date-range">Nov 2019 - Nov 2020</span>
    </div>
    <p>As a Master's student, I was involved in the research effort of documenting and explaining the evolution of corporate sustainability behaviour. In this role, I contributed to the quantitative analysis of corporate sustainability efforts and performance, including applications of ESG ratings, GHG emissions, and accounting data. Using these datasets, I developed my Master's thesis as a pure microeconomic description of firm-level value maximization in a world where sustainability reduces cooperation costs between firms and input providers. I expanded my description in a symmetric duopoly case and characterized the corresponding Nash Equilibria as a function of the ``production team's" taste for sustainability.</p>
